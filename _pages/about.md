I'm a Master student at the Economics Department of Unicamp.
My research interests include Stock-Flow Consistent approach and indome distribuition. I have developed several R and Python routines, all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/gpetrini). 

# About this site

It is the repository for interactive stock-flow consistent models.
